# Best Free Cnc Engraving Software
  
I found one for $159.23 with a $5 coupon. This comes with an LU2-4LF 5 watt laser head. The reason I did not jump on this deal was because I have owned 2 of these machines previously and sold both recently. Makes no sense for me to buy another for this review.

The ACMER P1 S Pro 6 watt laser is now topping the list for my pick for Best Budget Laser Engraver. $199 gets you a super rigid frame, A Y axis movement that glides on 4 wheels instead of 3, and end stops.
 
If you wish to level up just beyond budget territory and not be at entry level, check out the ACMER P2 33 Watt laser I reviewed it here. It is a gem. I referred to it as the Best Laser Engraver for 2024.
 
**UPDATE JAN 2, 2023: The price has exploded to $288.99 currently. Other lasers have also had similar price jumps so this is still cheap by comparison. Hopefully, the price will fall again soon. Those earlier great prices might have been holiday offerings.**

What it ultimately says to me is the Aufero 2 is not all metal to metal and has areas that are isolated electrically. Translation: The machine is lighter and made with cheaper materials. But hey, this is a BUDGET laser.
 
Even though the machines look different, I can clearly see that the Aufero 2 is just an upgrade to the Laser Master 2 using the same basic construction and layout principles. The only difference really is those limit switches. Nothing wrong with that. Just saying.
 
After assembly I plugged it in and added the device to Lightburn. The installed firmware version was 1.87 so one of the first things I did was to upgrade to 1.90 (latest at the time of this writing.).
 
Budget machine, remember? But, however, comma, the mainboard has connections for limit switches. You could install your own limit switches and enable them in your machine settings and I have read tales on the internet where people have done just that.
 
While finding a capable laser engraver under $200 is not a difficult task, finding one at $170 is even harder. Couple this with the facts that it has some name recognition (Ortur) and it has decent documentation available. Also, shipping is US based and fast. Finally, the ability to purchase spare parts to keep you running in the event of a failure and you have truly stumbled into the best BUDGET laser engraver money can buy.
 
**UPDATE:** I 3D printed some riser feet and a focus block holder from here. I had to print the focus block holder at 102% as the first print at the original size was too tight. I attached all to a spoil board and created my own grid in Lightburn. Turned out great.
 
I am trying to engrave on black acrylic and then apply paint as I have seen before but my engraving lines are bumpy. Is there a special setting

I should use to get a smoother look so the paint looks crisp?
 
I've had a bit of a search and a few different places seem to suggest that Boxwood is the best wood for engraving, however I'm sure that there are a number of viable choices, and certainly for beginners who aren't trying to achieve very fine detail then any wood which will hold a good edge (so most moderately dense hardwoods) should be fine.
 
On the other end of the spectrum, you can try oak too. It's hardness on one hand allows good details, but it's coarse grain lends carvings a texture that you don't get using other woods. It's certainly not all-purpose, but maybe something to keep in mind. Likewise, a species like mahogany would be a medium - coarseness grain.
 
How to Identify Prints (Bamber Gascoigne} is a book that describes methods of making prints; in particular types of woodcuts, wood engravings; to determine what wood is right for the type of work you wish create it would help to know the possibilities. The image you show in your question appears to me to be better identified as a wood cut for which the birch plywood might serve, not as well for a wood engraving where an end grain is the norm, though early wood engravers often used edge grain for their work. Wood engravers tools are very specialized and are also described in the book.
 
Just to toss out the alternative: linoleum blocks are cheap and easy to cut. You don't get the entertainment/practice of working with and against wood grain, but on the other hand they're (close to) type-height and thus easy to lock up in a letterpress. I did this one many years ago with nothing more than a pocketknife. Apologies for the slightly blurry photo; the edges are actually quite sharp and captured more detail than I expected. Actual size of the block is about 3x4 inches. I'm showing it both on white, and textured grey, paper; the ink is Delft Blue.
 
Look into Diamond Drag Bits. They are pretty forgiving and you can get some pretty good detail with them. They essentially scratch the surface but do a pretty good job on acrylic. I have something similar to this: -4-CNC-45-90-DEGREE-DRAG-ENGRAVING-TOOL-BIT-WITH-SPRING-LOADED-DIAMOND/192479839073?hash=item2cd0b14361:g:yF4AAOSw8oxaqyRH
 
What Adam said. For most engraving sizes 75-100ipm is plenty fast. Acrylic is pretty forgiving compared to metals like brass or aluminum. It is also a little dependent on how deep/how much pressure you put on the bit.

My X-Carve is heavily modified and I use V-Carve Pro. But if you want to use easel, it may work to make your letters fatter than the original to make up for the 30 degree angle. If you HAVE V-carve then, you are all set!
 
For an UN-modified X-Carve, I would start with .002 Dept of cut and go .01" deep. Test it to see if gives you an ok brand. If not you may have to go deeper. V-Carve enables you to use a larger bit to clear material which is helpful and also accounts for the angle of the bit. Here is the reverse of what you are talking about but look inside of the M for raised detail. This was only cut .006" deep. I think for a brand, you would have to go deeper.20180226\_07462737562112 1.67 MB
 
I have some of the 20 degree engraving bits from Inventables. Are those sufficient and appropriate for cutting brass? Or would I be better off ordering the titanium-coated bits you recommended from Amazon?
 
My X-carve is a smaller custom sized unit. The rails are integrated into the base, the x-axis is solid, I use a custom Z axis with a balls screw and a Makita router. It is driven by a Gecko G540 48volts. It is very, very rigid. I mill a pocket in MDF before the carve to true the wasteboard to the brass work piece. Still, I break the engravings into separate small pieces and re-zero the z-axis before each one for consistency of depth across the entire piece.
 
Engraving Details:
The 20 degree should be fine - but more likely to break. 30 degree bits are a little more robust. I use coated and uncoated - whatever is cheapest - I have not noticed a difference in performance. I set my bit to .003" tip diameter and .003" depth per pass (80% stepover) at 40 inches per minute and 30 inches per minute on the plunge. Then, if it is going well, I manually increase the speed during the cut (I use Mach 3 CAM). I also use flood coolant, which is not necessary but extends the life of the bit and provides cleaner pockets.
 
Milling Details:
I prefer to profile the pieces use .25" four flute bits at .01" Doc 40 IPM, if the shape allows. Bits last longer, cuts faster and deeper, etc. Otherwise, .125" two flute at .005" Doc 40 ipm. For holes, I pocket the hole rather than drilling to provide breathing room. I do not profile greater than .25" thick material with a .125" bit.
 
I pocketed the hole to make sure it was true. But with the bits you recommend I get a pretty rough outcome. Is it that the 1000mm xcarve cannot do cursive like this without stair stepping at this size? the plaque is 12mm x 64mm.
 
I decided to screw the tags down. Notice the difference between tape and screwing down, though I like the hand scratched feel of the other as well.Second, a major difference is in the wear of the bit, do you use a new bit every time? I would say every time my bit is duller, see image below, is this because 10in/min is too fast?
 
I am so excited to share this Cricut engraving tool with you! This tool is for the Cricut Explore machine, so that you can engrave on acrylic and metal. This is great for people who own a Cricut Explore machine and are not yet ready to upgrade to the Maker just to get the Cricut brand engraving tip.

As you might know, Cricut has an engraving tip but it is only available for use with the Maker machines. Since I own the Cricut Explore machine, I have not done a lot of engraving projects. I did do one engraved acrylic ornament which you can see HERE, but the process dulled my blade.
